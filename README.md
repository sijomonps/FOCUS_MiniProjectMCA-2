# 🎯 FOCUS – Simple Study Dashboard

FOCUS is a small web app that helps students see their study life in one clean place: time spent, subjects, assignments, and streaks.

It is built as an MCA Semester 2 mini project using **Python + Django**.

---

## 🧠 Problem It Solves

Many students:

- Study for hours but **don’t know how much they really did**
- **Forget assignments** until the last minute
- Have notes **spread across books, photos, and random apps**
- Find it hard to **stay consistent** day after day

FOCUS was made to handle these simple but real problems.

---

## ✅ What FOCUS Gives You

- **Dashboard** – see today’s study time, streak, weekly/monthly graph, and subject breakdown
- **Study Timer** – start a focused session with a subject; time is saved automatically
- **Assignments** – add tasks with deadlines and see urgency visually
- **Quick Notes** – keep short notes grouped by subject
- **Leaderboard & Streaks** – small motivation boost by seeing top learners and your own streak

Everything is designed to be minimal, calm, and easy to understand even on first use.

## 🎓 Who Is This For?

- School / college students who want a **simple study tracker**
- Beginners who are **new to productivity tools**
- Anyone who wants to **see their progress instead of guessing**

You don’t need any technical knowledge to use the website.

## 🚀 Run the Project (Local Setup)

1. Open a terminal in the project folder.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
        ```

3. Install dependencies and set up the database:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

4. Start the server and open the site:

        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

        Then visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000
